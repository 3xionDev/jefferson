        <p class="info-content">Historical sources show that Jefferson referred to his 1801 election as the "Revolution of 1800." He believed that the previous two presidencies had likened too much to royalty, and he was determined to set a less formal precedent for future presidents.</p>

    <div class="content-boxes">
        <p class="info-content">Famously, Jefferson demonstrated this idea at his inauguration by wearing a simple suit with no wig or sword. In his inaugural address, he stated his intention to heal the divide between the Federalists and the Republicans: "Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans: we are all Federalists."</p>

        <p class="info-content">Jefferson was a strong believer in small government. He wanted to limit federal power and give the states enough independence to deal with their own internal issues. He believed that the primary focus of the government should be foreign affairs - namely commerce. He also believed that defense against foreign entanglement such as war was also another essential function of any government. He began the process of paying the federal debt, cutting spending, and removing largely disliked policies such as the Whiskey Tax.</p>

        <p class="info-content">In order to prevent a repeat of the Election of 1800, Jefferson and Congress passed the Twelfth Amendment, which requires electors to cast separate votes for president and vice president, thereby preventing a tie from occuring again.</p>

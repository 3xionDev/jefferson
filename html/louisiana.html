        <p class="info-content">Jefferson had a firm belief that a republic's key to survival was most of its citizens owning land. Because of this, Jefferson was a vehement supporter of the expansion of America's land into the West. This need for expansion was enflamed in 1800 when French leader Napoleon Bonaparte convinced Spain to trade Louisiana back to France in exchange for helping Spain take control of a part of Italy. This deal worried Jefferson because it gave France control of the lower part of the Mississippi River and the port of New Orleans</p>

        <p class="info-content">Jefferson's fears were all but confirmed in October 1802 when New Orleans revoked the right of Americans to store goods there for reshipment. In response to this, Jefferson told his ambassadors to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans with France. In 1803, Napoleon was short on funds for his conquest of Europe and spontaneously offered to sell all of the Louisiana Territory AND New Orleans to America. Naturally, the ambassadors immediately took the offer.</p>

        <p class="info-content">America sealed the deal with France on April 30, 1803. They bought all of the Louisiana Territory for $11.25 million. In addition, they also resolved French debts owed to America of around $3.75 million, making the total cost about $15 million. Though Jefferson originally worried about the constitutionality of acquiring new territory, the Senate immediately approved the Louisiana Purchase. This purchase nearly doubled the side of US territory and gave America control of the entire Mississippi River.</p>

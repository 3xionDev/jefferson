        <p class="info-content">In order to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Territory, Jefferson needed an expedition. To lead this expedition, Jefferson chose Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. The purpose of this expedition was to find a route to the Pacific Ocean through the Louisiana Territory, They set out in May of 1804, with Clark bringing his enslaved servant York. York hunted for the expedition, scouted trails, and navigated waterways. He also traded with the Native Americans, cooked, and provided medical aid to the members of the expedition.</p>

        <p class="info-content">On their way westward, the team met a fur trader Toussaint Charbonneau and his wide Sacagawea. Their meeting was fortunate and resulted in both of them joining the expedition as interpreters for the Hidatsa and Shosone people.</p>

        <p class="info-content">In 1805 the explorers (with the addition of Sacagawea and Charbonneau and their infant son Jean-Baptiste) set off for travel again. After trading with the Shoshone for horses, the explorers eventually found a path through the Rocky Mountains and traced a path to the Pacific Ocean. The expedition had the added benefit of staking a US claim in Oregon Territory.</p>

        <p class="info-content">In 1800, President John Adams decided to run for a second term of presidency. Unfortunately, he had made the nation a little angry with him. This resulted in the Federalist party as a whole opposing his campaign. The Republican party stood behind their nominees, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. Naturally, Adams lost, and Jefferson and Burr were left in a tie for presidential nomination, with 73 electoral votes each.</p>

        <p class="info-content">This tie revealed a crucial flaw in the Constitution's system for election. The Constitution does not let citizens elect presidents directly; instead, each state chooses electors. The Electoral College will then vote for a president. Under the original terms of the Constitution, each elector would vote for two people: one for president, and one for vice president.</p>

        <p class="info-content">In order to avoid a tie, the Republican party intended for one elector to refrain from voting for Burr. This, however, did not happen. Because no candidate had the electoral majority, the House of Representatives (which was controlled by the Federalists) had to select the winner. The majority of Federalists despised Jefferson, and the lock was not broken for a period of time. However, Alexander Hamilton personally despised Aaron Burr, and he convinced his followers to support Jefferson. In February of 1801, the Federalists selected Jefferson, thereby making him the third president of the United States.</p>

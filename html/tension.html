        <p class="info-content">For many years, Mediterranean shipping had been menaced by the Barbary States on the North African coast (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli). In response, the Americas and Europe had paid money to these countries to ensure their ships were not attacked. When they needed more tribute money, Tripoli declared war on the US in 1801. Without consulting with Congress, Jefferson ordered a naval squadron to the Mediterranean, resulting in the first foreign military conflict in US history.</p>

        <p class="info-content">On top of this, Britain was desparate for recruits due to their ongoing war with France. They resorted to impressment, which was a legalized form of kidnapping that allowed Britain to force Americans into military service. British ships would stop American ships and search for British deserters, and would impress the American crew as a result. Essentially, they would steal Americans. In 1807 an incident involving a British warship and an American ship resulted in the death of three Americans. Jefferson responded by closing all American waters to British ships and redirecting funds to coastal defense and warships.</p>

        <p class="info-content">This attack on an American ship enraged the public, who called for war. Jefferson did not declare war, however. Instead, he passed the Embargo Act of 1807, which halted all trade from the US to Europe. Jefferson hoped this embargo would force the British and the French to allow free trade and shipping between America and Europe. In order to enforce this restriction, Jefferson urged Congress to pass additional restrictions on the export of American goods. However, Britain and France were not hurt by this embargo, instead turning to other trading partners to fill in the gaps left by the US. This resulted in a net downside for America, and Congress repealed the embargo in 1809.</p>
